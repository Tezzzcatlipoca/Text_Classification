[Reports to the Surgeon-General Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service.] 

Report from Vanceboro, Me. — Precautions taken on Canadian border 
to prevent importation of smallpox. 

Acting Assistant Surgeon Young reports, February 12, as follows: 
During the week ended February 12 I inspected 722 passengers, 

vaccinated 16, and disinfected 3 pieces of baggage. Admission was 

refused to 2 persons who came from smallpox-infected and nondisin- 

fected houses. 

Since my last report the provincial board of health has been 

requested to assume charge of the disinfection in Sun bury county.
