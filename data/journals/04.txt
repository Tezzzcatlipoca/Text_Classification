They confront us on all sides. Even the storing of food supplies shows how little 
sanitary requirements are regarded. One has only to walk through any of the bazaars 
to see heaps of grain on the roadside exposed to sewage dust or to notice food stuffs 
in small and dirty shops covered with flies, while close at hand are latrines and 
urinals with the surrounding soil saturated with filth and organic refuse of all kinds. 
The conclusion come to by experts who have carefully studied the sanitary condi- 
tion of Poona and its neighborhood is that its unhealthfulness is due to sewage con- 
tamination of the soil. * * * The pit and trench systems of sewerage are open to 
many objections, having had most disastrous effects upon the health of British troops 
and civil residents quartered in the cantonments. Poona is advantageously placed 
for efficient sanitation, provided that it makes use of its natural advantages and of 
modern sanitary methods. It has an abundant water supply which should be used 
for the removal of its sewage, but not for its disposal, for the entrance of the sewage 
of towns and cantonments into Indian rivers is altogether objectionable. The adop- 
tion of the septic-tank system is strongly advised, and in addition structural altera- 
tions in densely inhabited localities with attention to surface drainage. 

With reference to the street cleaning of Poona, the Times says: 

In the early morning the center of the ordinary cantonment road is swept and 
horse droppings brushed aside, right and left, and allowed to remain. Soon after the 
traffic of the day has commenced it is impossible to tell where the nuisance of the 
early morning existed. 

What is said of Poona is true in large measure of other towns in 
India, and when one thinks of the large number of servants to whom 
Europeans must necessarily intrust the care of their food and the 
fetching of their water, the wonder is that so little enteric fever exists. 
The problem in Poona will be taken up seriously, in view of the great 
number of deaths among Europeans during the past four months. 

Plague in the Bombay Presidency, 1903 — Deaths among the inoculated. 
Mortality from plague, 1896 to 1903. 



1896 2,086 1902 184,752 

1897 46,944 1903 281,269 

1898 86,191 Mean, 1896 to 1899 57,954 

1899 96,596 Mean, 1900 to 1903 156,869 

1900 33,196 Mean, 1896 to 1903 107,412 

1901 128,259 

It will thus be seen that the plague mortality was worse than in any 
previous year since its outbreak in 1896.

The heaviest mortality was in the two districts, Belgaum and Dhar- 
war, of the southern province. The details are as follows:

In other words, 92,043 deaths, or 32.72 per cent of the total plague 
mortality for the Presidenc} r , occurred in these two districts. The 
plague mortality in them was as follows:' 

Per thousand. 

Belgaum 45.37 

Dharwar 42.26 

Total for both districts 43. 72 

Monthly mortality. 

The disease rose steadily from July of 1902, continued severe 
through the first quarter of 1903, and fell to a minimum in May and 
June. Notwithstanding the widespread and fatal character of the 
scourge, only 18.27 per cent of towns and villages were affected, as 
against 10.38 per cent last year. 

In 7 towns plague was the cause of over half the general mortality, 
and in the remaining towns greatly raised the annual general death 
rate. 

Plague deaths among the inoculated. 

In compliance with Government orders, a record of those who had 
been inoculated with antiplague prophylactic and who subsequently 
died of plague was kept. To judge of the value of the prophylactic, a 
register of all persons inoculated should have been available, and a 
record then kept to show how many of these subsequently were 
attacked and died. The returns record merely the number of deaths 
among inoculated persons. Of 281,269 who died of plague during the 
year 1903, 2,156, or 0.76 per cent, had been thus inoculated at some 
previous date. 

Fever in the Bombay Presidency, 1903.

Mortality from fevers, 1892 to 1903.

1901 291, 951 

1902 270,845 

1903 259,704 

Mean, 1892 to 1897 405, 488 

Mean, 1898 to 1903 301, 763 

Mean, 1892 to 1903 353, 626 



1899 228,438 | Mean, 1893 to 1902 354,577 

Thus, with two exceptions, the deaths from fever are less than in 
any previous year since 1892, and are far less than the mean for the 
past six years. The comparison of the mean mortality for the first 
period with that of the second period of six years shows a tendency 
toward diminution in the fever mortality. 

Of 259,704 deaths in 1903, there were 134,048 among males and 
125,656 among females. 

Classification of fevers. 

"In the absence of registration, supported by medical diagnosis, it 
is impossible to ascertain what proportion of fevers in the districts of
