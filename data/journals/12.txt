THE SALE OF BICHLORIDE TABLETS. 

A DISCUSSION OF THE NEED FOB RESTRICTION OF THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION 
OF BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY TABLETS. 

By Martin I. Wilbebt, Technical Assistant, Hygienic Laboratory, United States Public Health Service. 

Some months since an alleged case of accidental poisoning by corro- 
sive mercuric chloride, in Macon, Ga., was "featured" in practically 
all of the daily papers of the United States in such a way as to lead 
the unknowing to infer that poisoning by this substance guaranteed 
not alone a sure but also a painless death. 

The notoriety given this case was followed by an apparently unusual 
number of corrosive sublimate fatalities, reported from the various 
parts of the United States; and the publicity given to the harrow- 
ing details in connection with several of the cases was in turn followed 
by agitation for legislation on the part of some of the firm believers 
in the power of statute law to right all wrongs and to correct or, 
better, to prevent all possible abuses. 

Bills designed to restrict fatalities from the accidental taking of 
tablets containing corrosive mercuric chloride have been introduced 
in several of the State legislatures. In Pennsylvania, an act pro- 
hibiting the sale of bichloride of mercury at retail except upon the 
prescription of a registered physician was adopted by both houses of 
the legislature, but vetoed by the governor for the reason that "the 
public is amply protected regarding this drug by the restrictions put 
upon the sale of other poisons. Besides, I am informed that it is a 
household commodity." As the agitation for special legislation to 
restrict or at least regulate the sale of tablets of corrosive mercuric 
chloride is destined to be revived by the supposedly accidental poi- 
soning of a Brooklyn business man and to continue for some time to 
come, it may be of advantage to review briefly the several factors 
involved, the abuses really existing, the propositions that have been 
made to correct them, the safeguards already established, and the 
possible ways and means of bringing about desirable changes. 

While it will generally be admitted to be impracticable to prevent 
suicide or violent death by law or regulation, it is nevertheless well

recognized that despondent and melancholy humanity is ever ready 
to seize upon any suggestions that offer sure, speedy, and painless 
death, so that every report of death, accompanied by the details of 
the means and methods producing it can be counted on as an incen- 
tive for other deaths brought about in much the same way. 

It is perhaps unfortunate that, for the rational study of the prob- 
lem before us, no definite and satisfactory information is available 
as to the conditions actually existing in our own country. Our 
mortality statistics give only general death rates and standardized 
death rates, without furnishing any, even approximate, information 
regarding the nature of the poison used or taken in cases of reported 
fatalities. There is, however, available in the report of the registrar- 
general of births, deaths, and marriages for England and Wales, 
a detailed account of the nature and kind of substances used, both 
in suicides and in accidental deaths, and a careful study of the tables 
herewith presented will suffice to demonstrate the impracticability 
of legislating specifically for any one poison. The tables also at 
least suggest the fact that there is probably little or no cause for 
undue excitement in regard to the possible number of deaths from 
the internal use of corrosive mercuric chloride and that, granting 
that conditions in England and this country are much the same, 
corrosive mercuric chloride plays but a minor part in the number of 
deaths due to ingested poison. This fact is further emphasized when 
we realize the very widespread use and, incidentally at least, abuse, 
of tablets of corrosive mercuric chloride and the comparatively few 
fatalities on record resulting from its internal administration. Even 
a careful search of the literature since the report of the case at Macon, 
Ga., shows that possibly 15, certainly not over 20, deaths have been 
reported from the ingestion of corrosive mercuric chloride since that 
time. When we remember that in the registration area of the 
United States upward of 5,000 deaths from acute poisoning are 
reported annually, even these apparently large figures are suggestive 
as being comparable with those included in the appended tables 
copied from the report of the registrar-general for England and 
Wales.

November 14, 1913 2402 

Corrosive mercuric chloride was introduced as an antiseptic in 
surgical procedure more than 30 years ago, and for two decades at 
least was widely known by the popular names "corrosive sublimate," 
''bichloride," or "sublimate," and used in the form of solutions for 
a variety of purposes. This widespread use led to its employment 
in other directions, so that at the present time the statement made 
by the governor of Pennsylvania that bichloride of mercury "is a 
household commodity" is altogether too true, particularly of the 
tablets — pounds, if not tons, of which are sold annually for other 
than medicinal purposes. 

A survey of the current price lists of five of the larger manufac- 
turers of pharmaceutical preparations in the United States, presents 
some rather startling information, and suggests a really valid reason 
why tablets of corrosive mercuric chloride may be considered to be 
more important factors in the health and welfare of many members 
of the community than is generally supposed. Perhaps the most 
startling discovery is the fact that not a single manufacturer of tablets 
of corrosive mercuric chloride markets them under a name properly 
indicating the nature of the materials contained therein. In the 
lists referred to we find, under corrosive sublimate, mercuric chloride 
or mercury bichloride, a cross reference to antiseptic tablets or anti- 
septics, and under this heading the several price lists mentioned 
would present the following composite table : 

A composite list of antiseptic tablets from the current price lists of five leading manufac- 
turers. 

Antiseptic disks. — Compressed. Green or white. Corrosive mercuric chloride 0.5

Antiseptic tablets, Wilson's. — White, green, pink, or blue. Corrosive mercuric 
chloride 0.5 gm. with ammonium chloride. 

The tablets in this listcontaining corrosive mercuric chloride are mar- 
keted in 16 varying sizes, 5 different shapes, and 5 different colors. 
Three of the shapes are distinctive and probably proprietary in 
nature. Obviously the most objectionable feature is the confusion 
which may arise from the totally misleading name applied to tablets 
containing highly toxic materials. 

The possible abuse arising from the use of a totally misleading 
name for poisonous substances is further emphasized by the state- 
ment recently made by one of the agitators for legislation to provide 
a distinctive shape for "antiseptic tablets." This writer says: "It 
is a known fact that the tablets of corrosive sublimate are very easily 
procured, and are used to a very large extent as a home remedy, 
hence they are not looked upon as the dangerous agents that they 
really are in the hands of the careless and ignorant." 

Among the many suggestions that have been made to compel 
uniformity in shape and size of tablets of corrosive mercuric chloride, 
we have proposals to have them triangular, coffin-shaped, kidney- 
shaped, and in the shape of a skull, in addition to the various forms 
already in use. Suggestions have also been made to enact laws to 



November 14, 1913 2404 

compel manufacturers to color these tablets red, green, blue, yellow, 
and pink; also to give them a distinctive odor, and to compel their 
being dispensed in a uniform and distinctively shaped bottle; all of 
which, if it were practicable to enforce uniformity in all States and 
with all manufacturers, would at best tend to elaborate on the misuse 
of tablets of this kind, rather than to prevent accident, or their use as 
a poison for suicidal purposes. 

Even at the present time there is sufficient legislation, if en- 
forced, to serve as a reasonable safeguard in connection with the sale 
of corrosive mercuric chloride at retail. No less than 38 States in- 
clude corrosive sublimate specifically in the laws designed to restrict 
the sale of poisons, and in but one of the existing laws, that of Utah, 
are corrosive sublimate tablets exempted from registration in the 
poison register, otherwise uniformly required for the sale of corrosive 
sublimate itself. During the present year, three States, Oregon, 
Nevada, and California, have enacted modified poison laws and 
specifically enumerate tablets of corrosive sublimate as belonging in 
"Schedule A," drugs, the sale of which is required to be registered in 
a book provided for that purpose. These several States also spe- 
cifically enumerate "antiseptic tablets containing corrosive subli- 
mate," being, so far, the only States recognizing the present-day 
custom of labeling these very toxic preparations, "antiseptic tablets." 

In addition to specific agitation for the proper labeling of all 
preparations containing poisonous substances, the most promising 
innovation is the suggestion that a type form of corrosive mercuric 
chloride tablet or pastille be introduced in the Pharmacopoeia of the 
United States, with a view of providing adequate safeguards to pre- 
vent accidental poisonings. While the suggestions that have been 
made for this purpose are many and varied, it would appear that, 
in view of the rapidly growing intercourse between the different 
countries of the world, it might be desirable to secure international 
uniformity in regard to preparations of this type. It has been pro- 
posed, unless specific and valid objections could be offered, to adopt 
for inclusion in the Pharmacopoeia of the United States the descrip- 
tion of mercuric chloride pastilles included in the German Pharma- 
copoeia. This latter Pharmacopoeia provides that pastilles of mer- 
curic chloride consist of equal parts of corrosive mercuric chloride 
and sodium chloride, and requires that the pastilles be colored bright 
red with aniline dye, have a cylindrical shape, and be twice as long 
as thick. These tablets or pastilles must be wrapped individually in 
black paper, bearing the German equivalent of the word poison in 
white letters. The weight of a tablet must be stated, and the 
wrapped tablet is to be dispensed only in suitable glass bottles or 
tubes. 



2405 November 14, J <1 1 3 

As an argument for including in the Pharmacopoeia of the United 
States an official tablet of corrosive mercuric chloride, rather than 
enacting legislation to compel uniformity in the shape, size, color, and 
odor of all tablets containing corrosive mercuric chloride, it has been 
pointed out that inclusion in the Pharmacopoeia would not in any 
way interfere with the legitimately established trade of manufacturers, 
but would tend to discourage the sale and use of such preparations 
and bring about the gradual popularization of the official tablet. If, 
in addition to this, it were practicable to induce manufacturers 
properly to label all of their preparations so as to indicate the pres- 
ence of any highly toxic substance, and then to suggest to purchasers 
of tablets of this land the need for keeping them apart or in such a 
way that they could not readily be mistaken for other nontoxic 
preparations, little or no additional legislation would be necessary, 
unless it were to restrict newspapers from publishing unnecessary 
details in regard to the nature and kind of poison used in cases of 
accidental or intentional poisoning. 



NEOSALVARSAN IN BRAIN SYPHILIS. 

A REPORT OF A CASE OF BRAIN SYPHILIS TREATED WITH NEOSALVARSAN, WITH 

RECOVERY. 

By C. L. Williams, Assistant Surgeon, United States Public Health Service. 

Within the past two years there have appeared in the medical 
journals a number of reports of severe and even fatal cerebral dis- 
turbances following the use of salvarsan and neosalvarsan in the 
treatment of syphilis. Kavant (Presse M6dicale, Paris, Mar. 2, 1912, 
reviewed in Journ. A. M. A., Apr. 13, 1912) cites a series of cases in 
which examination of the spinal fluid after salvarsan injection showed 
in secondary cases a more or less severe effect on the central nervous 
system ranging from simple increased pressure to severe inflamma- 
tion. He advises examination of spinal fluid in all secondary cases 
and extreme caution in the use of salvarsan where evidence of dis- 
turbance is found. Oltramare (quoted in New York Medical Jour- 
nal, vol. 95, p. 1065) advises caution in use of salvarsan in syphilis 
of liver, kidneys, and brain. R. Voller (Munchener Md. Woch., vol. 
59, No. 36) cites 5 cases of choked disk following the use of salvarsan. 
Lesser (Ber. Klin. Woch., Mar. 25, 1912) has reported 18 cases of 
epileptiform attacks after salvarsan injection and Lube (Derma- 
tologische Zeitschrift, vol. 20, No. 8) has reported 25 similar cases, 
which he further describes as presenting the clinical picture of 
cerebral intoxication. Schestophal (Berl. Klinik, May, 1913) and 
Assman (Berl. Klin. Woch., vol. 49, No. 51) report fatal cases with 
acute cerebral symptoms after salvarsan injections.
