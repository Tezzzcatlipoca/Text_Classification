On the 16th instant, the Spanish steamship Monseratt arrived here 
from Spain, reporting 1 death on board. The patient died of appendi- 
citis. There was also 1 case of sickness on board which was diagnosed 
malarial fever. 

Acting Asst. Surg. Jose M. Campos reported another case of yellow 
fever occurring in a Spaniard at the port of Batabano, also a case at 
Cienfuegos. The necessary steps have been taken for the proper 
inspection of vessels leaving that port for noninfected ports on the 
south coast. 
I inclose the mortality table for the week ended September 22, 1900.
